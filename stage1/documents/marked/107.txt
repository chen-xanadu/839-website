As they debate expressions of faith and role of the Church in the tumultuous America of the sixties, they must also contend with the antics of two rebellious, trouble-prone students, <p>Rosabelle</p> (<p>Susan</p> <p>Saint</p> <p>James</p>) and <p>Marvel</p> <p>Anne</p> (<p>Barbara</p> <p>Hunter</p>).
