Mistaken at first for a deserter, Army captain <p>Tom</p> <p>York</p> rides into the town of Deadwood after the Little Big Horn massacre. He has come to warn the townspeople of a likely Sioux attack.
Somewhere in the area is hidden a pair of Gatling guns, which would be vital to fending off such an assault. The only person who knows the hiding place is <p>Dakota</p> <p>Lil</p>, a saloonkeeper who already has lost her husband and son in battle and wants no more part of it.
Ultimately persuaded by <p>York</p> to reveal where the guns are, they are betrayed by a gambler, <p>Elkins</p>, who intends to sell them to the enemy for a profit. <p>York</p> and others manage to get them back, and once everyone is town is safe, he decides to put down roots there with <p>Dakota</p> <p>Lil</p>.
