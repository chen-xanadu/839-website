The Molly Maguires were a secret organization of Irish coal miners established in nineteenth century Pennsylvania to fight oppressive mineowners. Led by <p>Jack</p> <p>Kehoe</p>, they plant dynamite to destroy plant shafts and equipment, as real life Pinkerton Detective <p>James</p> <p>McParland</p> is employed to infiltrate the Mollies.
<p>Kehoe</p> and <p>McParlan</p> are working class immigrants from Ireland with essentially the same aspiration - advancement in the new society to which they have come. <p>McParlan</p> coldly betrays the group whose leader he has befriended and <p>Kehoe</p> kills to advance his cause. <p>McParlan</p> also develops a romantic interest in <p>Mary</p> <p>Raines</p>, but she ends up offended by his treachery.
Awaiting execution, <p>Kehoe</p> tells his erstwhile ally that no punishment short of hell can redeem his treachery; Detective <p>McParlan</p> retorts that in that case, "See you in hell."
