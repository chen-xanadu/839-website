<p>John</p> <p>Burrows</p>, an ordained minister from a small village in the East, envisions himself with a larger congregation. He is mortified when his wife drunkenly interrupts a sermon, then despondent after her suicide.
<p>Burrows</p> travels to Los Angeles for a fresh start, but ends up on skid row and arrested for apparent public intoxication. A skid-row con man, <p>Gandy</p>, finds him a bed at a flop house, while a street preacher, <p>Doc</p> <p>Thorssen</p>, and daughter <p>Christine</p> take him to a local mission.
<p>Christine</p> is blind. She falls in love with <p>Burrows</p>, enjoying his discussions of the spirit and the soul but knowing little of his past. One day she is struck by a streetcar and knocked unconscious, causing <p>Burrows</p> to once again question his faith.
He ultimately accepts the Lord's will and is offered a better place to live and preach. <p>Burrows</p> decides he is better suited to the mission, with <p>Christine</p> by his side.
