<p>Ernst</p> <p>Graeber</p> is a German soldier stationed on the Eastern Front during the war's last days. He and fellow soldiers <p>Steinbrenner</p> and <p>Hirschland</p> are ordered to kill Russian civilians, but <p>Hirschland</p> commits suicide instead.
Given his first furlough in two years, <p>Ernst</p> returns home to find his village bombed and parents gone. <p>Elizabeth</p> <p>Kruse</p>, daughter of his mother's doctor, tells him that her father is being held by the <p>Gestapo</p> as well. Constant air raids interrupt any peaceful moments while <p>Ernst</p> and <p>Elizabeth</p> enjoy their love.
An old friend, <p>Binding</p>, a wealthy Nazi, welcomes <p>Ernst</p> to his home and prepares a feast for the newly wed couple, while a sympathetic professor, <p>Pohlmann</p>, offers his help, should they decide to flee the country.
<p>Ernst</p> is ordered back to the front where he finds <p>Steinbrenner</p> about to shoot arrested Russian civilians. To prevent their shooting <p>Ernst</p> himself shoots <p>Steinbrenner</p> and frees them. One of the prisoners untouched by such sentimentally in a total war retrieves <p>Steinbrenner</p>'s rifle and then shoots <p>Graeber</p>. He dies while reading a letter from <p>Elizabeth</p>, telling him that she is expecting their child.
