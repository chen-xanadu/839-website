Co-ed <p>Lee</p> <p>Sullivan</p> (<p>Sherry</p> <p>Jackson</p>), a student at an unnamed California college, inherits a house on the beach from her late uncle. She wants to use the building as boarding house for girls, thus both alleviating the student housing shortage and financing her education.
Meanwhile, <p>Adam</p> <p>Miller</p> (<p>Frankie</p> <p>Randall</p>), plans to turn the beach house into a boys' boardinghouse, claiming that he received permission to do so while <p>Lee</p>'s uncle was still alive. <p>Adam</p> secretly files first for an off-campus housing permit, and the boys take up residence in the house. <p>Lee</p> also receives a permit, and naturally, problems develop when both male and female students decide to co-habitate - this administrative mix-up also makes for much ducking and dodging of the university authorities.
In spite of being at odds with each other, a romance blossoms between <p>Lee</p> and <p>Adam</p>.
