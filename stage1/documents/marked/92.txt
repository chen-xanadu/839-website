Quietly planning to go duck hunting, <p>John</p> <p>Josephus</p> <p>Grant</p>, a U.S. Supreme Court justice, tells his secretary <p>Lucy</p> <p>Gilbert</p> where he will be but no one else. A fish-and-game warden promptly insists he pay an extra fee for a license and toss in a "tip." <p>Grant</p> refuses and ends up in town, facing possible criminal charges.
There he discovers honest lawyer <p>Bill</p> <p>Adams</p>, running for mayor against the incumbent, <p>Connison</p>, someone he considers to be corrupt. Judge <p>Austin</p> <p>Harkley</p>, businessman <p>Blaxton</p> and even the sheriff appear to be in the mayor's pocket, and when <p>Bill</p> is insulted and throws a punch, they conspire to keep him in jail.
<p>Joe</p> intervenes on <p>Bill</p>'s behalf without telling anyone his true identity. He helps free <p>Bill</p> in the first legal dispute, then does likewise for <p>Lucy</p> after she shows up and is denied a room at the local hotel for no good reason. <p>Joe</p> ultimately admits who he really is, causing <p>Bill</p> to faint. Once he recovers, his political career begins.
