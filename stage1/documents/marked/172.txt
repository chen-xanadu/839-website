"Bad" <p>Bascomb</p> (<p>Beery</p>) is a notorious outlaw wanted by federal marshals after outwitting every group sent to capture him. He and fellow bandit <p>Bart</p> <p>Ramsay</p> (<p>Naish</p>), a cold-blooded killer, have again eluded the marshalls by joining a Mormon wagon train heading to Utah. They pretend to be helpful, and <p>Bascomb</p> becomes fond of an admiring little girl played by <p>O'Brien</p>. <p>Beery</p> eventually distances himself from the other thief and saves the wagon train from an attack by Indians, before being taken captive by the law at the end of the movie.
