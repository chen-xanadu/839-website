<p>Will</p> <p>Tenneray</p> and <p>Abe</p> <p>Cross</p> are two aging, famous gunfighters, both in need of money. <p>Cross</p> rides into town, having failed as a gold prospector. His reputation is such that everyone expects him to shoot it out with <p>Tenneray</p>, who capitalizes on his legend by working at the saloon to "sucker fools into buying drinks." To the town's surprise, <p>Tenneray</p> and <p>Cross</p> take a liking to one another. There is no hostility between them whatsoever.
<p>Tenneray</p> is desperate for money, however. He comes up with the idea to stage a duel to the death in a bullfight arena, with the ticket proceeds going to the winner. Unfortunately, by killing <p>Cross</p>, he reasons to <p>Nora</p>, his wife, "I could lose my best friend." The actual gunfight is shot in a low-key and unromanticised fashion, and is over in a couple of seconds, <p>Cross</p> killing <p>Tenneray</p> with the first bullet. (This defies conventions with the "man in black" winning.)
There is an extended fantasy sequence near the end, where we see what might have happened if <p>Tenneray</p> had won, which may have confused some viewers. It may be open to interpretation if this is <p>Cross</p>'s fantasy or <p>Tenneray</p>'s widow's fantasy.
