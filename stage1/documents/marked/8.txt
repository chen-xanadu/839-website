The Stooges play the proprietors of the Cafe Casbah <p>Bah</p>, a Middle Eastern restaurant. One morning, <p>Moe</p> and <p>Larry</p> are awakened by their crying sweethearts, who are in need of money to pay off a bad debt. While attempting to prepare a meal for customers <p>Hassan</p> <p>Ben</p> <p>Sober </p>(<p>Vernon</p> <p>Dent</p>) and the Gin of <p>Rummy</p> (<p>George</p> <p>Lewis</p>), the Stooges try to think of a way to raise the needed cash. In the interim, they discover a plan that their hungry customers are hatching. These two thieves are attempting to rob the tomb of <p>Rootentooten</p>, which contains a priceless diamond, but they discover that the Emir of <p>Schmow</p> (<p>Johnny</p> <p>Kascier</p>) has already gotten his hands on the diamond. The two plotters start wailing and are thrown out of the restaurant. The Stooges then attempt to retrieve the diamond themselves, as there is a $50,000 reward at stake.
The Stooges arrive at the Emir of <p>Schmow</p>'s palace, all three dressed as <p>Santa</p> <p>Claus</p>. They then manage to acquire the diamond and make a quick exit, but not before dealing with a burly guard.
