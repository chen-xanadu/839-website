In post-World War II Hong Kong, unhappily married <p>Carol</p> (<p>Eleanor</p> <p>Parker</p>) has an affair with a married man, <p>Paul</p> (<p>Jean</p> <p>Pierre</p> <p>Aumont</p>). Her physician husband <p>Walter</p> (<p>Bill</p> <p>Travers</p>) discovers it and presents her with a choice: travel with him to a remote mainland village (where he will fight a cholera epidemic) or face the scandal of a very public divorce. She persuades him to reconsider and he proposes an alternative. If <p>Paul</p>'s wife will agree to a divorce and he marries <p>Carol</p> within one week <p>Walter</p> will obtain a quiet divorce. <p>Carol</p> presents <p>Walter</p>'s 'deal' to <p>Paul</p>, who regretfully declines, citing respect for his wife.
<p>Carol</p> sees as her only choice to accompany <p>Walte</p>r to the village, where she meets the rakish and booze-soaked <p>Tim</p> (<p>George</p> <p>Sanders</p>). He soon introduces her to nuns at the local hospital-convent and <p>Carol</p> begins to re-evaluate her self-absorbed life and character.
Working at the convent, <p>Carol</p> learns she is pregnant. She tells <p>Walter</p> she's unsure who is the father and he regrets her honesty. Shortly after, <p>Walter</p> contracts cholera and dies. <p>Carol</p> returns to Hong Kong and an uncertain future.
