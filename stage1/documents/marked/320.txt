A radical plan is Dr. <p>Paul</p> <p>Furman</p>'s idea when the governor assigns him to take charge of a youth reformatory, replacing <p>Colonel</p> <p>Walton</p> with a notion to offer inmates more trust. Not only does <p>Furman</p> ease the institution's usual strict discipline, he changes it from an all-boy detention facility to co-ed.
Juvenile delinquent <p>Eddie</p> <p>Bassett</p> observes with interest as new female inmates like <p>Kitty</p> and <p>Babe</p> arrive along with adult supervisors <p>Grace</p> <p>Hartwell</p> and <p>Bess</p> <p>Monahan</p>, who will look after the girls. As soon as the bashful <p>Kitty</p> expresses an interest in <p>Eddie</p>, the extroverted <p>Babe</p> causes trouble for her, causing <p>Kitty</p> to be injured in a fight and later attacked by another boy. <p>Furman</p> is also physically assaulted by <p>Eddie</p>.
Various misdeeds lead to the governor's firing <p>Furman</p> and restoring <p>Walton</p> and the previous discipline. <p>Eddie</p>, beaten by a guard named <p>Quillan</p>, steals the guard's gun, knocks him out and leads a revolt. The only one able to quell the uprising is <p>Furman</p>, who, with <p>Kitty</p>'s help, successfully appeals to <p>Eddie</p> to give up before it's too late.
