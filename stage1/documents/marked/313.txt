<p>Howard</p> <p>Tyler</p> (<p>Frank</p> <p>Lovejoy</p>) is a family man, living in California, who can't seem to get by financially. He meets up with a small-time, but charismatic, hood <p>Jerry</p> <p>Slocum</p> (<p>Lloyd</p> <p>Bridges</p>). Soon, <p>Slocum</p> convinces <p>Tyler</p> to participate in gas station robberies to get by. Later, they kidnap a wealthy man in hopes of getting a huge ransom. Things go wrong when the man is murdered by <p>Slocum</p> then thrown in a lake. <p>Tyler</p> reaches his limit emotionally, and he begins drinking heavily. He meets a lonely woman and confesses the crime while drunk. The woman flees and goes to the police.
When the two kidnappers are arrested, a local journalist (<p>Richard</p> <p>Carlson</p>) writes a series of hate-filled articles about the two prisoners which eventually lead to a brutal lynching.
