<p>Cantor</p> <p>Rabinowitz</p> (<p>Eduard</p> <p>Franz</p>) is upset that his son <p>Joey</p> (<p>Jerry</p> <p>Lewis</p>) has left home to pursue a career as a singer/comedian after showing no interest in carrying on the family's tradition of being Cantors in the synagogue. After five generations of doing so, it appears that <p>Joey</p> is more interested in making jokes and singing jazz music.
After a few years on his own, <p>Joey</p>, who now calls himself <p>Joey</p> <p>Robbins</p>, gets an opportunity to perform on the television show with <p>Ginny</p> <p>Gibbons</p> (<p>Anna</p> <p>Maria</p> <p>Alberghetti</p>). Unfortunately, his father falls ill during his rehearsal performance, and he runs to his side, putting show business aside for his family obligations.
