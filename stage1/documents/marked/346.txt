On his teenaged son <p>Georgie</p>'s birthday, <p>Andy</p> <p>LaMain</p> is beaten with a cane by <p>Al</p> <p>Judge</p>, a crippled newspaperman. He does not fight back, confusing <p>Georgie</p>, who also wonders why his widower Dad's girlfriend <p>Frances</p> did not come to the birthday party.
<p>Georgie</p> gets a gun and goes looking for <p>Judge</p>, first in a boxing arena where he is introduced to a Dr. <p>Cooper</p>. They go to a jazz club and soon <p>Georgie</p> gets to know <p>Cooper</p>'s girlfriend, <p>Julie</p>, and sister, <p>Marion</p>, who kisses him but hides his gun.
Finally finding <p>Judge</p>, he holds him at gunpoint and demands to know where <p>Frances</p> has gone. <p>Judge</p> explains that <p>Frances</p> was his sister and committed suicide because <p>Georgie</p>'s father refused to marry her. A struggle for the gun ensues and <p>Judge</p> is shot.
The police come to arrest <p>Andy</p>, believing him to be the shooter until <p>Georgie</p> confesses. <p>Andy</p> reveals to his son that he didn't wed <p>Frances</p> because he was still married to <p>Georgie</p>'s mother. She is not dead after all, but ran off with another man.
