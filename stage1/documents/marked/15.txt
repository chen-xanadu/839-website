A rogue exile impersonates a King and a virtuous person wants to be so because he is the rightful heir to the throne.
Loosely based on The Brigand by <p>Alexandre</p> <p>Dumas</p>, the film is set in the Napoleonic era in 1804 in the mythical Iberian nation of "Mandorra". The film bears a resemblance to The Prisoner of Zenda with <p>Dexter</p> playing a dual role of a rogue exile who impersonates a King in danger of being overthrown by his cousin played by <p>Anthony</p> <p>Quinn</p>.
The scheming <p>Quinn</p> plans a "premeditated accident" to King <p>Lorenzo</p> by giving him a hunting weapon that is rigged to fire backwards; an idea reused by director <p>Phil</p> <p>Karlson</p> in his The Silencers. With the real King unable to perform his duties, the swashbuckling distant relative <p>Carlos</p> <p>DeLago</p>, late of the Sultan of Morocco's Guard steps in to save the Kingdom.
