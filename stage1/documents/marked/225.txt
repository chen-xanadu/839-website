Having loved and trained horses since she was a little girl, <p>Jane</p> <p>Drake</p> is devastated when her dad Dr. <p>Tim</p> <p>Drake</p>'s farm is sold to <p>Dean</p> <p>MacArdle</p>, who also intends to abandon the longtime tradition of harness racing to bring in "bangtails" to race.
<p>Dean</p> is kind enough to sell <p>Jane</p> her favorite trotter, Yankee Doodle, for just $5. While she and her dad Doc <p>Drake</p> nurse that horse back to health, she persuades <p>Dean</p> to enter Doodle's old stablemate, Yankee Clipper, in the upcoming "Hiatoga Stakes," hoping to change his mind about harness racing.
<p>Jane</p> is disappointed when <p>Dean</p>'s snobby sweetheart <p>Cornelia</p> <p>Hunt</p> shows up. She decides to enter Yankee Doodle in the same race out of spite, but after Yankee Clipper wins instead, <p>Dean</p> demonstrates to <p>Jane</p> once more that his heart's in the right place.
