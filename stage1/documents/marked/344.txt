They impulsively decide to elope.
<p>Howard</p> and his wife (<p>Margalo</p> <p>Gillmore</p>) are furious, but when they confront the young professor's parents, they find them equally irate. The parents hit the road together hoping to head off the kids' marriage plans, while <p>Jake</p> and <p>Matt</p> begin to bicker and wonder if maybe things are going a little too fast.
