From a well to do family, <p>Adelaide</p> (<p>Maureen</p> <p>O'Hara</p>), over the objections of her family, marries an impoverished artist <p>Henry</p> <p>Lambert</p> (<p>Dana</p> <p>Andrews</p>) who is later killed in an accident when <p>Adelaide</p> pushes him away. <p>Adelaide</p> is blackmailed for two years by her neighbor, Mrs. <p>Mounsey</p>, a spiteful old hag (<p>Sybil</p> <p>Thorndike</p>) who claims to the police that <p>Henry</p> was killed accidentally.
<p>Adelaide</p> is still living in the Britannia Mews, when a young barrister, <p>Gilbert</p> <p>Lauderdale</p> (<p>Dana</p> <p>Andrews</p>), shows up who is the living image of <p>Adelaide</p>'s late husband. He gets rid of the old woman by threatening to prosecute her for blackmail, eventually reunites <p>Adelaide</p> with her family, and along the way falls in love with her himself.[2]
