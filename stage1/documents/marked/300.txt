A buzzard egg is mysteriously delivered to two sparrows, <p>Gwendolyn</p> and <p>Monte</p>. The "upper crusty" and very proper English Sparrows are not accustomed to having a repulsively ugly (and incredibly stupid) little bird about, but <p>Gwendolyn</p> convinces her husband that the baby bird will grow into a "beautiful swan". Unfortunately, as the narrator tells us, the little ugly bird grows into a very large ugly bird. <p>Monte</p> cannot even stand hearing the name of their "progeny", particularly when eating. But nonetheless, he takes <p>Beaky</p> out into the world to demonstrate the art of hunting for prey, such as barnyard fowl. Of course <p>Beaky</p>, being incredibly shy and inept, repeatedly causes many grievous injuries to <p>Monte</p>, and it is all <p>Monte</p> can do to salvage what little self-respect remains.
