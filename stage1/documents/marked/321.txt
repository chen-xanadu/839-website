<p>Sidney</p> <p>L.</p> <p>Pythias</p> (<p>Jerry</p> <p>Lewis</p>), a janitor, is mistaken for a gang member and arrested along with three so-called "juvenile delinquents," <p>Artie</p>, <p>Monk</p>, and <p>Harry</p>.
Police officer <p>Mike</p> <p>Damon</p> (<p>Darren</p> <p>McGavin</p>) believes he can help a wayward youth just as a cop once did for him. He is given a month by Captain <p>Riley</p> (<p>Horace</p> <p>McMahon</p>) to set a boy right, provided he allow socialite and civic do-gooder <p>Martha</p> <p>Henshaw</p> (<p>Martha</p> <p>Hyer</p>) assist him in the effort.
<p>Sidney</p>'s secret ambition is to be a policeman. He also wants to impress <p>Patricia</p>, a student nurse who lives in his building, by making something of himself. <p>Mike</p> and <p>Martha</p> bicker while working with <p>Sidney</p>, who is permitted to attend the police academy, over the objections of his "friends" <p>Artie</p>, <p>Monk</p> and <p>Harry</p>.
<p>Artie</p> is accidentally shot by a gun in <p>Sidney</p>'s possession, endangering his future with the police force, but it turns out Monk is responsible. Cleared of all blame, <p>Sidney</p> becomes a cop, determined to set a good example for youths like himself, while <p>Mike</p> and <p>Martha</p> fall in love.
