<p>Bo</p> <p>Hooper</p> (<p>Lewis</p>), a clown, finds himself unemployed when the circus where he works suddenly closes. He winds up living with his sister (<p>Susan</p> <p>Oliver</p>), against the wishes of her husband <p>Robert</p> (<p>Roger</p> <p>C.</p> <p>Carmel</p>). From there he goes from job to job, wreaking havoc along the way. He finally finds some stability as a postal worker, until he finds out that his boss is his girlfriend's father. The father hates all mail carriers because his daughter's ex-husband was one, so he tries to wreck <p>Bo</p>'s life, but <p>Bo</p> overcomes the odds and succeeds not only at work, but at impressing the father.
