On a cold and snowy night, <p>Bugs</p> wangles his way into the good graces, and more importantly, the house, belonging to an old lady (voiced by <p>Bea</p> <p>Benaderet</p>). <p>Sylvester</p>, her dog (voiced by writer <p>Tedd</p> <p>Pierce</p>), takes an instant dislike to the Bunny, and most of the cartoon is spent with the two tricking each other into going outside the house and getting locked out. Finally they get into a schtick where they are each throwing the other out the front door in turn, in quick succession. The old lady, fed up with all the bickering by now, intervenes (out of frame) and tells them both to get out, when suddenly she is thrown out, startled and indignant. Bugs and the dog have made peace, and are lazing by the fire. Bugs turns to the audience and says, in typical fashion, "Gee, ain't I a stinker?"
