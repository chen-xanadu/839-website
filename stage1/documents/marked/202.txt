Childhood friends <p>Rocky</p> <p>Barnes</p> (<p>Stevens</p>) and <p>Dan</p> <p>Purvis</p> (<p>O'Brien</p>) are Los Angeles prowl car cops on night duty. <p>Barnes</p> is easygoing while <p>Purvis</p> is a cynic who views all lawbreakers as scum. Both men are attracted to radio communicator <p>Kate</p> <p>Mallory</p> (<p>Storm</p>) but she is reluctant to get involved with policemen, her cop father having been killed in the line of duty.
One night <p>Rocky</p> and <p>Dan</p> arrest murderous racketeer <p>Ritchie</p> <p>Garris</p> (<p>Buka</p>) but he escapes and swears vengeance. In a thrill-packed climax, <p>Garris</p> makes a desperate escape using a little kid as a shield. After <p>Garris</p>' girlfriend (<p>Robbins</p>) is killed stepping in front of his gun, <p>Purvis</p> shoots <p>Garris</p>.
