The story revolves around an early 20th century theatre troupe in Paris specializing in gory, naturalistic horror plays in the fashion of the Grand Guignol. The director, <p>Cesar</p> <p>Charron</p> (<p>Jason</p> <p>Robards</p>), is presenting <p>Poe</p>'s "Murders in the Rue Morgue". <p>Cesar</p>'s wife, the actress <p>Madeline</p>(<p>Christine</p> <p>Kaufmann</p>), whose mother (<p>Lilli</p> <p>Palmer</p>) had been murdered by axe, is haunted by nightmares of an ax-wielding man. Then, suddenly, <p>Rene</p> <p>Marot</p> (<p>Herbert</p> <p>Lom</p>), a former lover of <p>Madeline</p>'s mother thought long dead after being horribly disfigured on stage, mysteriously returns and begins murdering members and ex-members of the acting troupe, confounding the Paris police, who initially suspect <p>Cesar</p>.
