<p>Adam</p> <p>Chance</p> (<p>Peter</p> <p>Mark</p> <p>Richman</p>), works for an American agency, H.A.R.M. (Human Aetiological Relations Machine). He is assigned to protect Dr. <p>Jan</p> <p>Steffanic</p> (<p>Carl</p> <p>Esmond</p>), a recent Soviet defector who has developed a new weapon which fires spores that upon contact with skin slowly eat the body away.
Following Dr <p>Steffanic</p>'s arrival in the US he is taken into protective custody by H.A.R.M. and is placed in a beach house along with his niece and Agent <p>Chance</p> to develop a spore antidote. Here he reveals the communists' real plan, which is to dust all of the American crops with these deadly spores. During their time at this house <p>Chance</p> falls for <p>Steffanic</p>'s niece <p>Ava</p> <p>Vestok</p> (<p>Barbara</p> <p>Bouchet</p>), who is later revealed to be a communist spy. After the flat is attacked, Dr <p>Steffanic</p> is kidnapped by European spies and taken to a warehouse. <p>Chance</p> eventually rides in and a gun fight ensues in which <p>Steffanic</p> is exposed to the deadly spores in a valiant sacrifice, and dies. Afterwards, <p>Chance</p> re-appears at the beach house and arrests <p>Ava</p> for good.
