The steamship <p>Mary</p> <p>Deare</p> is found adrift at sea by salvager, <p>John</p> <p>Sands</p>. <p>Sands</p> boards it hoping to claim it for salvage, but finds the first officer, <p>Gideon</p> <p>Patch</p>, still aboard and trying to run the ship on his own. <p>Patch</p> has stayed on the ship in order to prove that it was sabotaged to collect insurance on cargo that had secretly been off-loaded at Rangoon.
<p>Patch</p> convinces <p>Sands</p> to help him beach the ship on the reefs of the Minquiers, even though it will void his salvage claim. When they return to London, <p>Patch</p> is brought before a board of inquiry to determine what happened. It soon becomes apparent that the ship owners were planning to wreck the <p>Mary</p> <p>Deare</p> all along and have <p>Patch</p> as the fall guy.
