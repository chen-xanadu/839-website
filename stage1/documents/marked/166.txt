<p>Victor</p> <p>Ballard</p> (<p>Fred</p> <p>MacMurray</p>) is a poor but happy-go-lucky New York sidewalk photographer who shares a studio apartment with a painter from Poland, <p>Stefan</p> <p>Janowski</p> (<p>Akim</p> <p>Tamiroff</p>). When <p>Victor</p> shoots a photo of <p>Alexandra</p> <p>Curtis</p> (<p>Mary</p> <p>Martin</p>), he realizes she is desperate and in need of a friend who can guide her through the ways and means of surviving in Manhattan with no money. <p>Alexandra</p> moves in as a third roommate and helps out with <p>Victor</p>'s street photography <p>Victoria</p> attempts to help her by getting her hooked up with a rich Park Avenue swell, but <p>Alexandra</p> accidentally meets his handsome son, <p>Paul</p> <p>Bryson</p> Jr. (<p>Robert</p> <p>Preston</p>) instead, and <p>Victor</p>, to his own surprise, becomes jealous. Before <p>Victor</p> and <p>Alexandra</p> come together as a couple, there are (of course) further misunderstandings and fisticuffs and the like.[1][2]
