<p>Steve</p> and <p>Jeff</p> are about to open a nightclub when a man named <p>Martin</p> <p>Drew</p> who represents conductor <p>Ladislaus</p> <p>Cassel</p> claims that <p>Cassel</p>, who is living next door, objects to the club's music and that it disturbs his granddaughter, <p>Victoria</p>, an aspiring opera singer.
It turns out that <p>Cassel</p> himself is fine with the club but <p>Vicki</p>'s grandmother <p>Lucia</p> is against it. <p>Cassel</p> also urges <p>Vicki</p> not to marry <p>Andrew</p>, her fiance, without being certain. After she meets <p>Steve</p>, she is attracted to him. <p>Steve</p> has a girlfriend, <p>Elaine</p> <p>Winters</p>, who is trying to persuade <p>John</p> <p>Braden</p>, a rich Texan, to finance the club. <p>Elaine</p> is upset about <p>Vicki</p>'s presence and threatens to marry <p>Braden</p>.
<p>Jeff</p> and his girlfriend, singer <p>Sue</p> <p>Jackson</p>, hope to get a new show off the ground, but both <p>Vicky</p>'s grandmother and <p>Steve</p>'s girl <p>Elaine</p> keeps interfering. <p>Cassel</p> offers to finance the show provided <p>Vicky</p> can be in it. <p>Lucia</p> is livid until she reluctantly attends the show, at which she is charmed and gives her approval.
