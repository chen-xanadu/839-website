<p>Bugs</p> <p>Bunny</p> is vacationing in the Ozarks and stumbles into the territory of two hillbilly brothers, <p>Curt</p> and <p>Punkin'head</p> <p>Martin</p>. The brothers figure <p>Bugs</p> as being a member of the clan they are feuding with and make several attempts to shoot him. <p>Bugs</p> foils them each time. <p>Curt</p> and <p>Punkin'head</p> are determined to get revenge on <p>Bugs</p> for their humiliation. <p>Bugs</p> easily outsmarts them and eventually, dressed as an attractive hillbilly girl, tricks them into doing a square dance. The dance tune starts as a straightforward version of "Skip to My Lou" played and called by the jukebox band. Shortly into it, <p>Bugs</p> deliberately unplugs the jukebox, removes the dress and takes over fiddling and square dance calling, still to the melody and rhythm of the song but manipulating the Martins through a series of slapstick comedy gags. <p>Bugs</p> proceeds to assign the Martins increasingly bizarre and violent directives, which the brothers unquestioningly follow with hilarious results. Finally, with the Martins having promenaded off a cliff, <p>Bugs</p> finishes the dance by saying, "And that is all!" before the cartoon ends.
