Half a million dollars is stolen from the Mafia by small-time crook <p>Harry</p> <p>Mitchell</p>, who splits it with girlfriend <p>Stacey</p> <p>Woodward</p> and takes off for Acapulco.
The mob sends hit man <p>Dano</p> <p>Villanova</p> to deal with <p>Harry</p> and get the money back. <p>Sol</p> <p>Madrid</p>, an undercover narc, is out to find <p>Harry</p> first, hoping to persuade him to testify against organized crime in court.
<p>Stacey</p> happens to be <p>Villanova</p>'s former girlfriend. Things get complicated in Mexico, where a heroin dealer named <p>Dietrich</p> is engaged in criminal activity while Mexican law official <p>Jalisco</p> is on the case. Before she can flee on a yacht, <p>Stacey</p> is taken captive by <p>Villanova</p> and shot up with dope until she's turned into an addict.
<p>Harry</p> is caught and killed. <p>Jalisco</p> isn't what he seems to be, so <p>Madrid</p> not only must deal with him, but with <p>Villanova</p> and <p>Dietrich</p> as well.
