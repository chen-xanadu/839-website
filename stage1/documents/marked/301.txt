A prospector named <p>Jonathan</p> <p>Harvey</p> (<p>Paul</p> <p>Kelly</p>), whose faithful companion is a rough collie named <p>Shep</p>, looks after the family of his late partner, <p>Martha</p> <p>Blake</p> (<p>Ann</p> <p>Doran</p>) and her son <p>Tommy</p> (<p>Gary</p> <p>Gray</p>). After years of digging in the hills of California (where the movie was shot), he finally strikes gold. However, before he can share it with the Blakes, his greedy partner <p>Lin</p> <p>Taylor</p> (<p>Bruce</p> <p>Cowling</p>) kills <p>Jonathan</p> and attempts to lay claim on the gold. He poisons <p>Shep</p>, who nearly dies, and nearly kills <p>Tommy</p>, but ultimately <p>Shep</p> recovers and leads <p>Lin</p> into the mountains, where he falls off a cliff to his death.
