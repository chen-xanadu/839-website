While barely conscious, <p>Jean</p> <p>Wilson</p> (<p>June</p> <p>Havoc</p>), a patient in a London hospital, overhears <p>Jimmy</p> <p>Del Palma</p> (<p>James</p> <p>Mason</p>) berating hospital staff for their treatment of his wife, who then dies shortly afterwards. To recuperate following a miscarriage, <p>Jean</p> coincidentally rents the former country home of <p>Del Palma</p>, a famous pianist, and his wife. She starts to fall in love with the absent musician and dreams of taking his dead wife's place, even of being taken over and possessed by her. With the encouragement of her friend <p>Sybil</p> (<p>Pamela</p> <p>Mason</p>), <p>Jean</p> arranges a seance with a medium in an attempt to contact the dead woman.
