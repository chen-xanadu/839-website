A foreign power, which is represented by their agent <p>Marlof</p>, attempts to set up secret missile bases in Canada to target the United States for their planned summer invasion. Meanwhile, acting on intelligence following the smashing of a spy ring in Montreal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers <p>Don</p> <p>Roberts</p> and <p>Kay</p> <p>Conway</p> go undercover in a settling party headed for the Yukon. <p>Marlof</p> also has agents, <p>Beck</p> and <p>Reed</p>, in the party en route to the site of the planned missile bases. Their attempts to disrupt the party only call the attention of the Mounties to the larger plot who, once the settlers finally reach their goal, continue to pursue the troublemakers, uncover their plot against the free world, unmask <p>Marlof</p> and bring them to justice.
