The movie is set at St. Francis Academy (also the name of the school in Sister Act 2), a fictional all-girls Catholic boarding school in Pennsylvania, operated by an order of nuns. <p>Rosalind</p> <p>Russell</p> plays the Mother Superior, who spends the movie at odds with <p>Mary</p> <p>Clancy</p> (<p>Hayley</p> <p>Mills</p>), a rebellious teenager, and her friend <p>Rachel</p> <p>Devery</p> (<p>June</p> <p>Harding</p>). The episodic story line follows the young women through their sophomore, junior and senior high-school years as they pull pranks on the sisters and repeatedly get into trouble. Although <p>Mary</p> spends much of her time at St. Francis resenting the authority of the Mother Superior and puzzling over why any woman would choose the life of a nun, as time goes on she is touched by examples of the sisters' dedication, devotion, kindness, love, and generosity, and begins to see that their life is one of fulfillment, not deprivation. <p>Mary</p> receives "the call" senior year and, after graduation, remains at the school to begin her novitiate in the order.
