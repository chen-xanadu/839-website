After taking off from Vancouver, a Canadian Western Airways Douglas DC-3 airliner catches on fire and crashes in the Canadian north. On board were two young children, <p>Don</p> (<p>Lee</p> <p>Aaker</p>) and <p>Janet</p> <p>Heldon</p> (<p>Linda</p> <p>Lowell</p>), ultimately the only survivors. Their father, pilot <p>Vince</p> <p>Heldon</p> (<p>Howard</p> <p>Keel</p>) and his wife <p>Julie</p> (<p>Jane</p> <p>Greer</p>) join forces with the family friend, bush pilot "Brandy" (<p>Keenan</p> <p>Wynn</p>) and <p>Nora</p> <p>Stead</p> (<p>Patricia</p> <p>Medina</p>), the children's mother (from an earlier, but unsuccessful marriage) to mount a desperate aerial search before incoming bad weather arrives.
Tensions mount as the children face the danger of exposure and a mountain lion that begins to track them while the searchers themselves are in conflict as the hotshot pilot <p>Stead</p> creates problems with her constant efforts to take over the search. A final effort sees a reconciliation and a successful rescue in the nick of time.
