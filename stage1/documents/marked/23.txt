Dr. <p>Dan</p> <p>Scott</p> has developed a serum that cures the ills of animals, although it did alter the color of a leopard used in one experiment. Eager to try it on a human being, despite his mentor Dr. <p>Richard</p> <p>Bach</p>'s many concerns, <p>Scott</p> finds a consenting patient in <p>Kyra</p> <p>Zelas</p>, a woman with a meek personality who is dying of tuberculosis.
The serum seems to cure her instantly. It also dramatically affects her personality, <p>Kyra</p> shows a flash of temper, then jumps out of a car and runs into a shop, where she steals a dress and disguises her identity by willing her hair color to change from brunette to blonde.
<p>Scott</p> falls in love with her. At a party, however, <p>Kyra </p>seduces a guest, <p>Barton</p> <p>Kendall</p>, and when his wife <p>Evelyn</p> objects, <p>Kyra</p> disguises herself again and murders her. Then she marries <p>Kendall</p>, but behaves monstrously toward him. The doctors use a ploy that leaves <p>Kyra</p> in an unconscious state, then perform surgery to reverse the serum's effect, which also restores <p>Kyra</p>'s terminal disease.
