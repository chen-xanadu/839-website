<p>Omar</p>, the caliph, and <p>Yazmina</p>, the queen, arrange their infant son's escape when rival <p>Ali</p> decides to forcibly overthrow them. Before they are slain, they make sure the baby, his locket and magic carpet end up in the safe hands of an uncle, <p>Ahkmid</p>, a physician who then raises young <p>Ramoth</p> to manhood.
<p>Ramoth</p>, unaware he is the rightful heir but disapproving of <p>Ali</p>'s tyranny, disguises himself as "The Scarlet Falcon" and, assisted by friend <p>Razi</p> and <p>Razi</p>'s beautiful sister <p>Lida</p>, attempts to disrupt the caliph's reign. The evil <p>Boreg</p> becomes his nemesis, as does <p>Narah</p>, a princess who is the sister of <p>Ali</p>.
<p>Ahkmid</p>, mortally wounded by <p>Boreg</p>, reveals to <p>Ramoth</p> his true identity. <p>Lida</p> endeavors to infiltrate <p>Ali</p>'s forces by disguising herself as a dancer, but she is caught and imprisoned. <p>Ramoth</p> is also taken prisoner, but <p>Lida</p> escapes and sends the magic carpet to rescue <p>Ramoth</p> in the nick of time. <p>Ali</p> is killed, <p>Narah</p> placed in a dungeon as <p>Ramoth</p> and <p>Lida</p> fly off on the carpet to begin a new life.
