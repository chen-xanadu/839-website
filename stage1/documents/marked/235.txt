<p>Pete</p> <p>Ritchie</p> (<p>Raymond</p> <p>Burr</p>) runs a narcotics smuggling operation to the USA from Mexico, which the Los Angeles Police Department and the US federal government have unsuccessfully tried to stop. Because of <p>Ritchie</p>'s careful operating procedures, US authorities haven't even been able to find out the identities of his sources or customers and are desperate for a breakthrough. As a last resort, <p>Madeleine</p> <p>Haley</p> (<p>Claire</p> <p>Trevor</p>), an LAPD officer and former OSS operative, is sent undercover to Mexico to charm her way into <p>Ritchie</p>'s confidence.
Once there, <p>Haley</p> manages to establish contact with <p>Ritchie</p>'s gang, but is kidnapped by <p>Johnny</p> <p>Macklin</p> (<p>Fred</p> <p>MacMurray</p>), a federal agent posing as a hoodlum working for a rival of <p>Ritchie</p>'s and who also steals a load of <p>Ritchie</p>'s narcotics. <p>Haley</p> plays along and joins <p>Macklin</p> on a smuggling trip for the stolen narcotics, with <p>Ritchie</p> in hot pursuit.
