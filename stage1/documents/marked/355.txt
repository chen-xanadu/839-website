Mr. <p>Tucker</p> (<p>Platt</p>), proprietor of a Los Angeles coffee house, hires three down-on-their-luck patrons: out-of-work actor <p>John</p> <p>Mapes</p> (<p>Palmer</p>); struggling writer <p>Ray</p> <p>Miller</p> (<p>Lupton</p>); and <p>George</p> <p>Leland</p> (<p>Sullivan</p>), the wayward son of movie star <p>Rita</p> <p>Leland</p>, to participate in an armored car robbery to take place during a four-hour stopover in Chicago during the trio's train trip from Los Angeles to New York. <p>Mapes</p>' worried wife <p>Jeanne</p> joins him on the train, concerned about his not having had a job in more than a year.
<p>Tucker</p> and his henchman <p>Sidney</p> (<p>Glass</p>) fly ahead to set up the robbery, which goes off without a hitch. However, once back on the train, <p>Leland</p>'s greed gets the better of him. <p>Tucker</p> double crosses the trio, eliminating <p>Leland</p> and <p>Miller</p>, leaving <p>Mapes</p> as the only one left to stop <p>Tucker</p> from getting away with murder, along with the entire haul. <p>Jean</p> manages to keep police from shooting her husband as he foils the scheme. Movie star <p>Rita</p> is surrounded by reporters as she waits for son <p>George</p> to arrive on the train, unaware that he is dead.
