The rich Mrs. <p>Tuttle</p> (<p>Moorehead</p>) is upset that her daughter <p>Barbar</p>a (<p>Jill</p> <p>John</p>) is engaged to a man beneath their social stature, <p>Norman</p> <p>Phiffier</p> (<p>Jerry</p> <p>Lewis</p>).
<p>Phiffier</p>, a dog walker, is as awkward socially as he is physically. Mrs. <p>Tuttle</p> despises <p>Phiffier</p> but she arranges for him to get a job at one of her stores. She directs the store manager, <p>Quimby</p> (<p>Ray</p> <p>Walston</p>), to assign <p>Phiffier</p> a series of impossible and outrageous tasks, hoping he will become frustrated and quit, proving to her daughter that he is worthless. Instead, he becomes more driven and determined, and <p>Quimby</p> realizes that "he's a man of character".
<p>Barbara</p> has been keeping her heiress status to the Tuttle Department Store fortune a secret from <p>Phiffier</p>, knowing he is a proud person who refuses to marry her until he can afford to buy her a home. When her identity as an heiress is revealed, <p>Phiffier</p> breaks off the engagement and quits, returning to his previous job as dog walker.
<p>Phiffier</p> in this way does prove his worth to Mrs. <p>Tuttle</p> and she accepts him into her family.
