The president of an electronics company, <p>Alan</p> <p>Nichols</p> (<p>Andrew</p> <p>Duggan</p>), and his two vice presidents, <p>Robert</p> <p>Cannon</p> (<p>Jack</p> <p>Kelly</p>) and <p>Fred</p> <p>Vitale</p> (<p>Ray</p> <p>Danton</p>), are required at Cape Canaveral to oversee the test launching of a missile which their company developed. But before they are able to board the plane to take them there one of their suitcases is switched for one containing a bomb. <p>Cannon</p> opens his luggage when the men are in mid air and discovers the bomb, and his colleague <p>Vitale</p> manages to disarm it. The FBI is called in to determine whether this is a case of attempting to murder <p>Cannon</p>, whose suitcase contained the bomb, or an attempt to sabotage the air plane.
The investigation soon proves that electronics project engineer <p>Petersen</p> made and planted the bomb in the suitcase. <p>Petersen</p>'s motivation for doing this is that his son was fired by CEO <p>Nichols</p>, and when failing to blow up the plane he instead tries to blow up <p>Nichols</p> yacht, with the wife and her lover on it. The task for the FBI is to stop this endeavour.[2]
