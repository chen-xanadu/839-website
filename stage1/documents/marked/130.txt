<p>Victoria</p> <p>Layton</p> (<p>Anne</p> <p>Jackson</p>) is a suburban housewife who is dissatisfied with her marriage and fears that her sex appeal is fading. Her husband (<p>Patrick</p> <p>O'Neal</p>) works as a press agent, and his only client is a movie star who is known as an international sex symbol (<p>Walter</p> <p>Matthau</p>).
Upon hearing that The Movie Star (the character is not given a name, and <p>Matthau</p> is credited as "The Movie Star" in the closing credits) indulges in the services of prostitutes, <p>Victoria</p> decides to pose surreptitiously as one in order to prove to herself that she is still sexually attractive.
