<p>George</p> <p>Kelly</p> (<p>Charles</p> <p>Bronson</p>), dubbed "Machine Gun" by his partner in crime <p>Flo</p> <p>Becker</p> (<p>Susan</p> <p>Cabot</p>) because of his obsession with Thompson submachine guns, pulls off a bank robbery and eventually becomes Public Enemy #1. Discord grows among his inner circle, and <p>Kelly</p>, deathly afraid of being jailed or killed, is dominated and ridiculed by the tough-talking <p>Flo</p>.
A botched robbery causes one of their partners, <p>Michael</p> <p>Fandango</p> (<p>Morey</p> <p>Amsterdam</p>) to lose an arm. <p>Kelly</p>, goaded on by <p>Flo</p>, kidnaps the daughter of a wealthy businessman for ransom. <p>Fandango</p> fingers him to the police, but is killed by one of <p>Kelly</p>'s gang as the house is surrounded.
<p>Kelly</p> intends to surrender, if only to receive a more lenient sentence and avoid execution. <p>Flo</p> again questions his nerve, whereupon <p>Kelly</p> slugs her with his fist, knocking her unconscious. Both are taken away to jail.
