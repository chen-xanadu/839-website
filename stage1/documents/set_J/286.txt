The evening of the day <p>Ted</p> promotes <p>Howard</p>, <p>Howard</p> attends <p>Ted</p>'s house party where <p>Ted</p> urges him to pick up an available woman there and proceeds to show him how. <p>Howard</p> reluctantly tries it on <p>Catherine</p>, who instantly accepts. The two leave the party and go out for a little adventure on the town. <p>Ted</p> is oblivious, as he is concentrating on other women at the party.
