<p>Harry</p> <p>Stoner</p> (<p>Jack</p> <p>Lemmon</p>) is an executive at a Los Angeles apparel company close to ruin. With no legal way to keep the company from going under, <p>Stoner</p> considers torching his warehouse for the insurance settlement.
The arson is agreed to very reluctantly by his partner (<p>Jack</p> <p>Gilford</p>), a stable family man who watches <p>Harry</p>'s decline with alarm. Through it all, <p>Harry</p> drinks, laments the state of the world, and tries his best to keep the business rolling as usual. This last task is complicated when a client has a heart attack in the arms of a prostitute provided by <p>Stoner</p>.
With nerves still shaky, <p>Stoner</p> takes the stage at the premiere of his company's new line, only to be overcome by war memories. He ends the day spontaneously deciding to go home with a young, free-spirited girl hitchhiker, whose ignorance of his generation underscores his isolation from the world around him.
