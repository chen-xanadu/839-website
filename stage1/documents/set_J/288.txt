<p>Tommy</p> <p>Gibbs</p> (<p>Fred</p> <p>Williamson</p>) is an African-American who grew up in Harlem, New York City. As a kid, he was brutally assaulted by a cop named <p>McKinney</p>. The incident led him to a life of crime. As an adult, he joins New York mafia and becomes the head of a black crime syndicate in Harlem. He wages a gang war with the Italian mobsters of New York City and begins to establish a criminal empire, keeping a ledger book of all his dealings as leverage over his business associates, including <p>McKinney</p>.
He meets and falls in love with a singer named <p>Helen</p> (<p>Gloria</p> <p>Hendry</p>) and marries her. She is unhappy as he is violent and rapes her. Eventually his enemies conspire with her, leading to an attempt on his life that leaves him shot and wounded. Killing his would-be assassins, he returns to his office to retrieve the ledger book. <p>McKinney</p> meets him there, and attempts to humiliate him before killing him. <p>Tommy</p> overpowers <p>McKinney</p> and beats him to death. Retrieving the ledger, a badly wounded <p>Tommy</p> returns to the house where he grew up, but a street gang attacks, robs and, presumably, kills him.
