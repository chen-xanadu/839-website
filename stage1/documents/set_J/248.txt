<p>Ann</p> <p>Stanley</p>, who sells real estate in New York City, is on vacation with her mother in Greece when her car breaks down. To her rescue comes a young man on a motorbike, <p>Peter</p> <p>Latham</p>, who has a difficult time persuading <p>Ann</p> to accept a ride. They become better acquainted, drink ouzo, and ultimately consummate the relationship. <p>Ann</p> enjoys his company, but still views their relationship as a summer fling.
Back home, at a party one night, <p>Ann</p> is stunned when her grown daughter turns up with <p>Peter</p> as her date. <p>Peter</p> was not her daughter's date - he picked her up at her home in place of her daughter's date. It turns out, however, that <p>Peter</p>'s goal is to resume his romantic acquaintance with <p>Ann</p>, having developed feelings for her during the summer. The age difference embarrasses <p>Ann</p> greatly. He is 22, and she is 40. Friends and associates of <p>Ann</p> are somewhat aghast at her behavior as the persistent <p>Peter</p> refuses to take no for an answer. In time, after demonstrating a great deal of reluctance, <p>Ann</p> finally acknowledges that the only thing that matters is true love.
