<p>Veronica</p> <p>Fisher</p> (<p>Judy</p> <p>Garland</p>) enters <p>Oberkugen</p>'s music shop, looking for work. Although <p>Otto</p> <p>Oberkugen</p> (<p>Sakall</p>) is reluctant to take on more staff, she wins a job by persuading a wealthy matron, through her singing and musical expertise, to buy a harp at almost $25 over <p>Oberkugen</p>'s list price. Neither she nor <p>Andrew</p> <p>Larkin</p> (<p>Van</p> <p>Johnson</p>), the shop's senior salesman, suspects that they are each other's anonymous pen pal. They bicker constantly at work although becoming increasingly attracted to each other.
