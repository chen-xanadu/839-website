Newton High music teacher <p>Malvina</p> <p>Adams</p> (<p>Risdon</p>) is asked to retire since attendance in her classes keeps dropping each year. Trying to prove she's still got it, <p>Adams</p> composes a school fight song which finds its way into the hands of bandleader <p>Bob</p> <p>Crosby</p> (playing himself) who turns it into an overnight hit. Though her niece <p>Abby</p> (<p>Rogers</p>) protests, <p>Malvina</p> travels to New York to perform her song with <p>Bob</p>'s band, while her niece falls for the bandleader. The newness of the song fades quickly though, and <p>Malvina</p> tries to write one more hit song before finally giving up and returning to Newton.
