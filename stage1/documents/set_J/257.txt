Detective <p>Virgil</p> <p>Tibbs</p>, now a lieutenant with the San Francisco police, is assigned to investigate the murder of a prostitute. A prime suspect is <p>Rev</p>. <p>Logan</p> <p>Sharpe</p>, a liberal street preacher and political organizer, who insists to Tibbs that he was merely visiting the hooker in a professional capacity, advising her spiritually.
<p>Tibbs</p> questions a janitor from the victim's building, <p>Mealie</p> <p>Williamson</p>, and <p>Woody</p> <p>Garfield</p>, who might have been the woman's pimp. Suspicion falls on a man named <p>Rice Weedon</p>, who takes umbrage and is shot by <p>Tibbs</p> in self-defense.
<p>Tibbs</p> concludes that <p>Sharpe</p> really must be the culprit. <p>Sharpe</p> confesses but requests <p>Tibbs</p> give him some time to complete his work on one last political issue. Told this wouldn't be possible, <p>Sharpe</p> takes his own life.
