The story takes place in 1903. During a train trip, psychiatrist Dr. <p>Huntington</p> <p>Bailey</p> (<p>George</p> <p>Brent</p>) meets a friendly older lady (<p>Olive</p> <p>Blakeney</p>). She tells him that she is going to visit her brother <p>Nick</p> and his lovely young wife <p>Allida</p>. Once in New York, <p>Bailey</p> hears that his train companion suddenly died. Shortly afterward, he meets the strange couple and becomes suspicious of <p>Nick</p>'s treatment of his wife. <p>Nick</p> (<p>Paul</p> <p>Lukas</p>) keeps <p>Allida</p> (<p>Hedy</p> <p>Lamarr</p>), whom he is trying to pass off as crazy, a virtual prisoner in their London town house [a New York brownstone in the film], cutting off all contact with the outside world. The kindly <p>Bailey</p> takes it upon himself to attempt to free his new love <p>Allida</p> from the control of the insanely jealous <p>Nick</p>.
A frenzied gun battle and fist fight in their home, featuring the destruction of several large aquariums, replete with shattered glass, gushing water and floundering fish may be the most memorable (and most often imitated) scene in the film.
