The Stooges are bellhops at Hotel Snazzy Plaza, and pound each other in order to get some face time with an attractive woman (the lovely <p>Christine</p> <p>McIntyre</p>, in her debut appearance with the team). Unfortunately, she has an evil mean-tempered husband (<p>Vernon</p> <p>Dent</p>) who happens to excel in knife throwing. The husband is also secretly importing <p>Lupe</p> the Wolf Man (<p>Duke</p> <p>York</p>) who goes berserk when he hears music. Later on, when <p>Curly</p> is cleaning their room, he snaps on the radio, and the wolf man goes on the rampage. The stooges head for the elevator back to the lobby which contains the Wolf Man inside who is playing with the elevator switch which cause to crash through the roof and sends the trio and the Wolf Man high into the sky.
