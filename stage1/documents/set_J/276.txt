<p>Jim</p> <p>Hilton</p> devotes too much time to his lodge membership and too little to his real-estate business. He lets daughter <p>Ethel</p> handle a potential purchase of the Draytons' riverfront property, whereupon she develops a romantic interest in the Draytons' son, <p>Tom</p>.
<p>Jim</p> inadvertently commits money he doesn't have to his lodge's hosting a convention. At dinner, he persuades Mr. <p>Drayton</p> to join the lodge and pay a $2,000 admittance fee, then uses the money for his own purposes. The family runs out of patience with <p>Jim</p>'s ways, and only daughter <p>Sprat</p>'s disappearance brings him to his senses, at least temporarily.
