<p>Wilma</p> <p>Tuttle</p> (<p>Young</p>) is a college professor who arouses the sexual interest of her student <p>Bill</p> <p>Perry</p> (<p>Douglas</p> <p>Dick</p>). When <p>Perry</p> tries to rape <p>Tuttle</p>, she beats him to death with a tire iron. She covers up her crime by making it seem as though <p>Perry</p> was killed while diving into the sea from a precipitous cliff. As she follows the police investigation of <p>Perry</p>'s death, <p>Wilma</p> realizes that she'll never be able to escape her conscience, especially when she falls in love with <p>Warren</p> <p>Ford</p> (<p>Cummings</p>), the dead boy's guardian.
