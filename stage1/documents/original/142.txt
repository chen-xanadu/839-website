After another gambler, Felix Bender, ends up dead after a dispute between them, Steve goes to Miami, where club owner Joe Marino and wife Ruby welcome him. Steve agrees to work for Joe after losing $50,000 in a crooked card game.

After an encounter between Don and Steve, a thug named Candy takes it upon himself to beat up Don, putting him in the hospital.
After causing Ruby to be killed by mistake, Steve makes an enemy of Joe, and they end up shooting one another. Steve dies in Georgia's arms.
