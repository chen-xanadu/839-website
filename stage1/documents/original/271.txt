From a well to do family, Adelaide (Maureen O'Hara), over the objections of her family, marries an impoverished artist Henry Lambert (Dana Andrews) who is later killed in an accident when Adelaide pushes him away. Adelaide is blackmailed for two years by her neighbor, Mrs. Mounsey, a spiteful old hag (Sybil Thorndike) who claims to the police that Henry was killed accidentally.
Adelaide is still living in the Britannia Mews, when a young barrister, Gilbert Lauderdale (Dana Andrews), shows up who is the living image of Adelaide's late husband. He gets rid of the old woman by threatening to prosecute her for blackmail, eventually reunites Adelaide with her family, and along the way falls in love with her himself.[2]
