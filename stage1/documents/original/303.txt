As described in a film publication, Arthur</> Rankin in the prologue seeks advice from Sydney, who then recalls a romance of his own youth which is then shown as a flashback. Sydney is in love with Keane, and the drama involves the conflict between his efforts to rise above worldly things or to leave with her. The romance ends with a deep note of pathos.
