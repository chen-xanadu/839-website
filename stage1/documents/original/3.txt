As described in a film magazine,[3] Jim Wynnegate, a young Englishman, assumes the guilt for the embezzlement of trust funds that were lost in speculation by his cousin Henry. He embarks to the United States and settles in the west, where he buys a ranch. In a quarrel with Cash Hawkins, Jim is saved from death by Naturich, a young Indian woman, who shoots the outlaw. He marries her out of gratitude and becomes known as the squaw man.
