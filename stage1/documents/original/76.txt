Foreign correspondent Rickey Mayberry (Dennis Morgan) hurriedly flies back from Spain to the U.S. to keep his wife from divorcing him, but he's followed on the flight by love interest Irene Malcolm (Rita Hayworth). Mayberry's wife Sue (Merle Oberon) has indeed divorced him, although she still loves him. The comedy of errors is compounded by Irene and also by Rickey's boss (James Gleason), who both conspire to keep the couple apart.
