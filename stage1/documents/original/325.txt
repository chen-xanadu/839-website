Set in Caldwell, Kansas on the Kansas-Oklahoma border, the movie features cowboy Hart as a "tumbleweed" (i.e., a drifter) who decides to settle down after falling in love with Molly Lassiter. Carver decides to get in on the Cherokee Strip land rush but when he's arrested and parted from his new love, he's in danger of missing the big race. Lucien Littlefield plays a strong supporting role in the movie as Hart's comic sidekick and best friend.[1]
