Most of the full plot is unknown. In the version available today, Holmes tells his nephews and children about an adventure he had in the woodlands around Slumber Mountain, near the Valley of Dreams. He finds the cabin belonging to the late hermit O'Brien, who Holmes's friend Joe once saw carrying a strange telescope-like instrument. That night, Holmes searches the cabin and finds the instrument. Upon doing so, the ghost of O'Brien instructs him to use it to look at the peak of Slumber Mountain.
