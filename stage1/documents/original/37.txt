As described in a film magazine,[1] Jules Leneau and his wife Jane, living in a cabin in the Northwoods, are inconsolable after the death of their infant son. Through the wicked scheme of Eason and his partner, trappers who live below the Leneaus, a child from the city is kidnapped and brought to the woods. The child wanders away and falls into a bear trap set by Jules, who discovers him there.
