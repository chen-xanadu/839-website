Under psychiatric care for several years, unknown to his employers, Doug Gerhardt has a job with a car dealership. He borrows a luxury convertible without permission to impress a date, but when she resists his advances at a motel, Doug kills her.
On the way home, Doug nearly runs over Marian Wood and her son. Still obsessed with women, Doug steals a toy belonging to the boy as an excuse for looking up Marian later. He ingratiates himself with Marian at home by repairing her washing machine, then preys on her frustration with husband Woody's frequent absence.
Doug's mother comes to see Marian, warning her about Doug's mental state and mistakenly believing Marian is romantically involved with him. Marian threatens to notify the police, after which Doug murders his mother, assaults Woody and takes their son captive. About to sexually assault Marian, he is killed when she stabs him with a nail file.
