Small-town girl Jane falls for Nick, a guy from the big city who offers her the opportunity to get away from her small-town life. He also offers her "headache powder" that she is unaware is really cocaine--and that Nick is a drug dealer. By the time they get to the city, she is hooked on her new medicine. Jane's brother Eddie goes to the city to look for her, after he and their mother don't hear from her for over a year.
