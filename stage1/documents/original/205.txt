Peter Potter (Bob Hope) is a dentist of doubtful competence. Out west, after the partner of Calamity Jane (Jane Russell) is killed while trying to discover who's been illegally selling guns to Indians, the cowardly Painless ends up married to Jane, who needs to keep her true identity a secret.
One day while protecting everyone during a hold-up, Jane gives all the credit to Painless, who becomes the townsfolk's "brave" new hero.
