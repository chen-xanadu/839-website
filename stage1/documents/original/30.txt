As described in a film magazine,[3] "Toodles" Walden, an automobile salesman who works for a sporty old automobile distributor Roberts, has racing ambitions and is in love with Ward's daughter Dorothy. The old man does not propose to give her up for five years and overreaches in an attempt to stimulate the young man with feigned complaints. They part company, but Ward is in despair when three racing machines are damaged in a train wreck.
