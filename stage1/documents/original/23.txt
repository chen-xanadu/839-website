Dr. Dan Scott has developed a serum that cures the ills of animals, although it did alter the color of a leopard used in one experiment. Eager to try it on a human being, despite his mentor Dr. Richard Bach's many concerns, Scott finds a consenting patient in Kyra Zelas, a woman with a meek personality who is dying of tuberculosis.
The serum seems to cure her instantly. It also dramatically affects her personality, Kyra shows a flash of temper, then jumps out of a car and runs into a shop, where she steals a dress and disguises her identity by willing her hair color to change from brunette to blonde.
Scott falls in love with her. At a party, however, Kyra seduces a guest, Barton Kendall, and when his wife Evelyn objects, Kyra disguises herself again and murders her. Then she marries Kendall, but behaves monstrously toward him. The doctors use a ploy that leaves Kyra in an unconscious state, then perform surgery to reverse the serum's effect, which also restores Kyra's terminal disease.
