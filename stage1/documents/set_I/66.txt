Immediately prior to the American Civil War, a Union officer (<p>Audie</p> <p>Murphy</p>), tries to prove local Navajo Indians are innocent of killing a prospector. He has to fight the anti-Indian attitudes of his superior officer (<p>Robert</p> <p>Sterling</p>) and North-South tensions within the soldiers. He discovers Confederate sympathizers are planning to cause the Indians to go on the warpath for their own benefit.
