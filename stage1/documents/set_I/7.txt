<p>Nick</p> <p>Dunn</p>, a used car salesman, can't close a deal with customers <p>Karen</p> <p>Winter</p> and <p>Arthur</p> <p>Markel</p>, so he is fired. A sympathetic <p>Markel</p> has a car lot of his own and offers a job to <p>Nick</p>, who quits after discovering <p>Markel</p>'s disreputable sales methods.
<p>Nick</p> and wife <p>Jane</p> have a financial dilemma when their son falls ill. Swallowing his pride, <p>Nick</p> asks for his job back with <p>Markel</p>, who promotes him to manager. But the criminal activity continues, until <p>Nick</p> becomes convinced that <p>Markel</p> has even ordered his henchman, <p>Smiley</p> <p>Ward</p>, to murder <p>Davenport</p>, a detective.
<p>Jane</p> is appalled by <p>Nick</p>'s new line of work. He seeks solace in the company of the beautiful <p>Karen</p>, but when the cops come to investigate <p>Davenport</p>'s death, <p>Karen</p> refuses to give <p>Nick</p> an alibi. Now a suspect, he tracks down <p>Ward</p>, who during their struggle at an amusement park falls from a roller coaster to his death. <p>Nick</p> tries to explain the hot-car racket to the police, implicating <p>Karen</p> and <p>Markel</p>.
