<p>Ricky</p> <p>Malone</p> has a new job at a resort and invites his talented friends, who are mistakenly under the impression that <p>Ricky</p> is entertainment director there. He actually has been hired by Mr. and Mrs. <p>Johnson</p>, the resort's owners, to do manual labor, and demands his friends help him work in the kitchen.
A singer who catches his eye and his ear, <p>Terry</p>, is mysterious about her past and won't tell <p>Ricky</p> why she seems to be running away from something. A detective, <p>Burkett</p>, tails her to the resort. The performers persuade <p>Ambrose</p> <p>Kenton</p>, nephew of Mrs. <p>Johnson</p>, to coax her into letting <p>Milton</p> <p>Delugg</p>'s musicians entertain the customers and to let the rest of them demonstrate what they can do.
After they get him drunk, <p>Burkett</p> reveals that <p>Terry</p>'s father hired him to bring her back and end her attempt to break into show business. <p>Terry</p> and the others are so talented, however, Mrs. <p>Johnson</p> hires them to remain on stage, and Broadway producers end up interested, too.
