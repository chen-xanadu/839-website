While stationed in Burma, buck privates <p>Jerry</p> <p>Miles</p> and <p>Mike</p> <p>Strager</p> are assigned to kitchen duty when they end up captured and taken to a prisoner-of-war camp with other soldiers, including Sgt. <p>Burke</p>, a man they know well.
The three escape and encounter two stranded American women, <p>Connie</p> and <p>Janie</p>, along the way. A clever ruse causes a company of Japanese soldiers pursuing them to plunge off a cliff. An elephant helps enable the five to get back to safety, although not before a Japanese tank begins firing at them. Everyone ends up safe and sound, although <p>Jerry</p> and <p>Mike</p> end up right back where they began, peeling potatoes.
