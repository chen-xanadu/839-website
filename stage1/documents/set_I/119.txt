Private detective <p>Michael</p> <p>Shayne</p> is puzzled when newspaper publisher <p>Gil</p> <p>Madden</p> offers him money to not take a case, whereupon <p>Mayme</p> <p>Martin</p> tries to hire him. He goes to see <p>Mayme</p>, exasperating secretary-girlfriend <p>Phyllis</p> <p>Hamilton</p>, who was counting on a vacation with <p>Shayne</p> and promptly quits.
After learning from <p>Mayme</p> that something's amiss at Santa Rosita racetrack, <p>Shayne</p> is ambushed and beaten by a pair of thugs. Newspaper reporter <p>Tim</p> <p>Rourke</p> is sent by <p>Shayne</p> to see <p>Mayme</p> and finds her dead.
<p>Shayne</p> learns of a counterfeit-ticket racket that is costing the racetrack a lot of money. He speaks with track manager <p>John</p> <p>Hardeman</p> and encounters <p>Ben</p> <p>Edwards</p>, a printer who does the track's tickets. <p>Edwards</p> turns out to be an escaped convict from <p>Joliet</p> whose fellow former inmate <p>Theodore</p> <p>Ross</p> is now a fugitive as well.
<p>Hardeman</p> is shot, as is <p>Edwards</p>. In the end, <p>Shayne</p> proves to Detective <p>Pete</p> <p>Rafferty</p> that it was <p>Ross</p>, now going by the alias <p>Madden</p>, who was behind the scheme. <p>Phyllis</p> forgives the private eye and begins planning their vacation.
