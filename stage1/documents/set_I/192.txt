In a small Iowa town in 1927, a traveling Chautauqua company arrives, with internal squabbles dividing the troupe. The new manager, <p>Walter</p> <p>Hale</p> (<p>Elvis</p> <p>Presley</p>), is trying to prevent <p>Charlene</p>, the troupe's "Story Lady" (<p>Marlyn</p> <p>Mason</p>), from recruiting the performers to form a union.
Meanwhile, the town has a scandal following the murder of the local pharmacist <p>Wilby</p> (<p>Dabney</p> <p>Coleman</p>). Although a shady gambler is arrested, <p>Walter</p> realizes that the real killer is <p>Nita</p> (<p>Sheree</p> <p>North</p>), one of <p>Wilby</p>'s employees.
<p>Walter</p> successfully gets <p>Nita</p> to confess during a Chautauqua performance, where she makes public the sexual harassment that <p>Wilby</p> directed at her. <p>Nita</p>'s self-defense plea frees the wrongly jailed man, but <p>Charlene</p> is outraged that <p>Walter</p> used the crime to financially enrich the Chautauqua, and attempts to quit.
<p>Walter</p> attempts to reason with <p>Charlene</p>, but when she refuses to give in, he deceives her and uses the local police force to be sure that she must leave on the train with the rest of the troupe.
