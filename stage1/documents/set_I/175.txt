<p>Lex</p> <p>Luthor</p>, the Atom Man, invents a number of deadly devices to plague the city, including a disintegrating machine which can reduce people to their basic atoms and reassemble them in another place. But <p>Superman</p> manages to thwart each scheme. Since Kryptonite can rob <p>Superman</p> of his powers, <p>Luthor</p> decides to create a synthetic Kryptonite and putters about obtaining the necessary ingredients: plutonium, radium and the undefined 'etc.' <p>Luthor</p> places the Kryptonite at the launching of a ship, with <p>Superman</p> in attendance. He is exposed to the Kryptonite and passes out. <p>Superman</p> is taken off in an ambulance driven by <p>Luthor</p>'s henchmen, and he is now under the control of <p>Luthor</p>. <p>Superman</p> is placed in a device, a lever is pulled, and the Man of Steel vanishes into "The Empty Doom".
