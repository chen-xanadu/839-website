Deep in the South American jungles, plantation manager <p>Barney</p> <p>Chavez</p> (<p>Burr</p>) kills his elderly employer in order to get to his beautiful wife <p>Dina</p> <p>Van Gelder</p> (<p>Payton</p>). However, old native witch <p>Al-Long</p> (<p>Gisela</p> <p>Werbisek</p>) witnesses the crime and puts a curse on <p>Barney</p>, who soon after finds himself turning nightly into a rampaging gorilla. When a wise but superstitious police commissioner <p>Taro</p> (<p>Chaney</p>) is brought in to investigate the plantation owner's death and a rash of strange animal killings, he begins to suspect that all is not as it seems. <p>Dina</p> is also becoming suspicious of <p>Barney</p>, who seems to be more in love with the jungle than with her. She follows him one night into the jungle, only to be attacked by the feral <p>Barney</p>. <p>Taro</p> and his friend Dr. <p>Viet</p> (<p>Conway</p>) follow her screams in the jungle and shoot <p>Barney</p>.
