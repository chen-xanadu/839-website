<p>Freddy</p> <p>Merkle</p> never finishes anything. He has a half-done painting, half a sculpture and a sonata he's been composing for quite a while. His girlfriend <p>Ginny</p> encourages him to finish something he starts, but <p>Freddy</p>, a delivery boy, never quite gets around to it.
After an accident in which his bicycle runs into a circus elephant, <p>Freddy</p> runs into Duke, a fast-talking operator who knows of a songwriting contest with a $2,500 first prize. At the coaxing of <p>Duke</p> and <p>Ginny</p>, the song is finally finished, but the sheet music blows away in the wind.
<p>Freddy</p>, forlorn as usual, decides to kill himself, but he can't even get that right. He's at the end of his rope when a kindly priest discovers the song, submits it to the contest and, sure enough, it becomes the winner.
