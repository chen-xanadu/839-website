Hollywood writer <p>Charlie</p> <p>Sorrel</p> (<p>Harry</p> <p>Madden</p>) is shot and killed by Hungarian film producer Sir <p>Leopold</p> <p>Sartori</p> (<p>Walter</p> <p>Matthau</p>) when he is caught fooling around with <p>Sartori</p>'s wife, <p>Rusty</p> (<p>Laura</p> <p>Devon</p>). Later, passerby <p>Bruce</p> <p>Minton</p> III (<p>Pat</p> <p>Boone</p>) comes to the aid of a dazed woman (<p>Debbie</p> <p>Reynolds</p>) wandering on a beach. She doesn't remember much other than directions to <p>Charlie</p>'s residence.
The next morning, it all comes back to her: she is the reincarnation of <p>Charlie</p>. After getting over the shock, she convinces her best (and only) friend, <p>George</p> <p>Tracy</p> (<p>Tony</p> <p>Curtis</p>), of her identity. All manner of complications arise as she first accepts the situation and then decides to take advantage of it, with <p>Tracy</p>'s reluctant help.
<p>Charlie</p> has changed his sex, but he cannot change his ways, and eventually he gets murdered again, only to be reincarnated again, this time as a dog.
