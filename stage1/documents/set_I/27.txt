The Stooges are three paperhangers who also look after invalid <p>Mary</p>, who uses a wheelchair. While working, they are taken by one poster that advertises a great[hypnotist, Svengarlic ("He'll steal your breath away!" the poster announces). The Stooges want the hypnotist to work his magic on <p>Mary</p> so that she can walk again, but <p>Svengarlic</p> is more interested in winning an audience to create a diversion by hypnotizing the Stooges.
While the audience watches the Stooges dance on an overhead flagpole, <p>Svengarlic</p>'s henchmen are in the process of robbing a bank. But a distracted bicyclist knocks <p>Svengarlic</p> over and the Stooges are abruptly awakened. They immediately panic when they see where they are, then the flagpole breaks, sending them flying through the open window of the bank being robbed, thwarting the theft.
