<p>Zandy</p> <p>Allan</p> is a hard-working cattle rancher in a remote part of the American West who needs a hired hand more than he needs a wife. He sends away for a mail-order bride, a Swedish woman who lives near Minneapolis. Expecting a woman in her 20s, <p>Zandy</p> is disappointed when <p>Hannah</p> <p>Lund</p> turns out to be 32. He is not interested in love, only in work, although this does not keep him from misbehaving around a local woman named <p>Maria</p>. <p>Hannah</p> is here, in his mind, strictly to help <p>Zandy</p> run his ranch and provide future sons. However, the more time he spends with <p>Hannah</p>, the less he comes to treat her as a possession that he has bought, in no small part because of her insistence that she be treated with respect.
