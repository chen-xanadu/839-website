Test pilot <p>Bruce</p> <p>Barton</p> (<p>Duncan</p> <p>Parkin</p>) is missing and his girlfriend, <p>Susan</p> <p>Winter</p> (<p>Gloria</p> <p>Talbott</p>) organizes a search party, sent out in the jungles of Mexico. The team of scientist <p>Russ</p> <p>Bradford</p> (<p>James</p> <p>Craig</p>), mining expert <p>Martin</p> "<p>Marty</p>" <p>Melville</p> (<p>Lon</p> <p>Chaney</p> Jr.) and pilot <p>Lee</p> <p>Brand</p> (<p>Tom</p> <p>Drake</p>) fly into an unknown territory. While searching the area, however, they uncover giant mutated earth animals such as giant snakes, lizards, behemoth bugs and oversized mammals.
More importantly, they encounter a mutated 50-ft tall, one-eyed human monster who became disfigured due to an exposure to radioactivity from massive radium deposits in the area. He kills <p>Melville</p> but appears to recognize the girl. When the cyclops tries to prevent the rest of the group from flying to safety, he is gravely wounded, and dies.
