In 1834, <p>Charles</p> <p>Stewart</p> (<p>Alan</p> <p>Ladd</p>), the spoiled, dissolute son of a shipping magnate, is shanghaied aboard the Pilgrim, one of his father's own ships. He embarks upon a long, hellish sea voyage under the tyrannical rule of Captain <p>Francis</p> <p>Thompson</p> (<p>Howard</p> <p>Da Silva</p>), assisted by his first mate, <p>Amazeen</p> (<p>William</p> <p>Bendix</p>). One of his crewmates is <p>Richard</p> <p>Henry</p> <p>Dana</p> Jr. (<p>Brian</p> <p>Donlevy</p>), who will ultimately recount the entire voyage on paper as a book.
