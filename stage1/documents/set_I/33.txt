It is an exceptional horse, but no one yet knows <p>Gay</p> <p>Fleet</p> because it is still young. <p>Rick</p> has been intentionally losing races to make the horse seem inferior so that he can buy it from <p>Carol</p> cheaply. However, he is discovered by <p>Mercedes</p>, a rival stable owner, who tells <p>Rick</p>'s plan to <p>Carol</p>.
