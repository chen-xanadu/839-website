The story of six affairs of the heart, drawn from controversial feminist author <p>Mary</p> <p>MacLane</p>'s 1910 syndicated article(s) by the same name, later published in book form in 1917. None of <p>MacLane</p>'s affairs - with "the bank clerk," "the prize-fighter," "the husband of another," and so on - last, and in each of them <p>MacLane</p> emerges dominant. Re-enactments of the love affairs are interspersed with <p>MacLane</p> addressing the camera (while smoking), and talking contemplatively with her maid on the meaning and prospects of love.[3]
