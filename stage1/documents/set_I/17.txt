The Stooges are warehouse workers who are assigned to delivering some Arabian antique for a Mr. <p>Bradley</p> (<p>Vernon</p> <p>Dent</p>). While unpacking the goods at Mr. <p>Bradley</p>'s house, <p>Shemp</p> stumbles upon a magic lamp that he, at first, dubs a "syrup pitcher." After giving the lamp a cleaning, a djinni appears (<p>Wesley</p> <p>Bly</p>), startling <p>Shemp</p>. Calling the djinni "genius," the Stooges are pursued by two Arabian thugs (<p>Philip</p> <p>Van Zandt</p>, <p>Dick</p> <p>Curtis</p>) who are after the magic lamp.
