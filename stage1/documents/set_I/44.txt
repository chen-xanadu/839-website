<p>Duncan</p> <p>Marsh</p> (<p>Steven</p> <p>Ritch</p>), a mild-mannered man, finds himself lost in a remote village called Mountaincrest. His mind is clouded, but he learns later that <p>Emory</p> <p>Forrest</p> (<p>John</p> <p>Launer</p>) and <p>Morgan</p> <p>Chambers</p> (<p>George</p> <p>Lynn</p>), two scientists, injected him with a special serum containing irradiated wolf's blood when he was suffering from amnesia after being in a car accident. The wolf's blood, for unknown reasons, has changed the previously gentlemanly <p>Duncan</p> into a vicious, bloodthirsty werewolf.
