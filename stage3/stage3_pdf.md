# Iteration

## 1st Iteration

- Sample set B: The 50 random samples are in the file `sample50.csv`
- |*B*| = 50
- |*n<sub>ap</sub>*| = 29
- Density: *d* = |*n<sub>ap</sub>*| / |*B*| = 0.58 > 0.2
- Since *d* > 0.2, the `densityFlag` is true and the loop breaks without further execution.
- The loop terminates and no more blocking rules are needed.
